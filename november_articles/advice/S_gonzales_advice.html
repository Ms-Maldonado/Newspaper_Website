  <p>The feeling at Blanson CTE High School is bittersweet for seniors. Many
    are seniors excited about continuing their education careers but also sad of
    the memories they made at Blanson. But as seniors end their last year of
    high school they would like to leave advice to share for underclassmen.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stay Focused.</span> It is important to not slack off or skip school because it
    will hurt you in the long run. Procrastination will become your worst enemy.
    Do not stress about an assignment later when you can do it right now. If this
    has become a habit, strive to change it and you will see your grades and
    your motivation improve. Remember that to achieve a high GPA, your
    freshman and sophomore year are critical.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be academically honest.</span> It may seem easier to cheat on a test or to
    get the answers from a friend but this is only setting you up for failure. You
    will start relying on cheating and not learn the material. This will affect you in
    situations where you will not be able to cheat. Cheating will also affect you in
    college as you will not be able to remember information from high school
    classes that will be needed in college.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Get ahead of your College career.</span> To attend the college of your
    dreams it is important to start working on your college application starting
    freshman year. Your GPA is important but it isnâ€™t your whole application.
    Another important part of it is your extracurricular activities. This includes
    your school clubs, community service activities, and jobs/internships. Lastly, I
    highly recommend you to start your college essay no later than the summer
    before senior year.</p>  
  <p>If you take this advice seriously your journey to graduation will be
    much smoother, and you will avoid stress when college applications open.
    There may be challenges but do not stress yourself out, keep pushing with a
    positive attitude and I am sure you will achieve your goals.</p>
