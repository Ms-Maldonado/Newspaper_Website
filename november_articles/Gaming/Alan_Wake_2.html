  <p> After over a decade, the sequel to the cult classic Alan Wake has finally 
    arrived. Alan Wake 2 is a direct sequel to the original game and still 
    connects to Remedy’s other titles like Control. The game follows two 
    protagonists, detective Saga Anderson and writer Alan Wake. Saga Anderson 
    is sent to solve a murder case in the city of the original game. The events 
    that occur are events that are written out in a book by none other than Alan 
    Wake. Alan Wake and Saga Anderson’s stories work in parallel to each other 
    as Saga deals with everything happening in the real world while Alan fights 
    his way through his own books. The storyline is packed with twists, unique 
    mechanics, and intriguing enemy types that’ll keep you entertained throughout
    your playthrough.
  </p>
  <p>Alan Wake 2 is a technological wonder that provides some of the best 
    visuals in gaming. Alan Wake 2 uses Remedy’s Northlight engine to create 
    lifelike visuals, animation, and physics without sacrificing too much 
    performance. Alan Wake 2 is still really taxing on your PC, even high-end 
    PCs will struggle to run the game at a high frame rate. The game’s 
    recommended PC specs are generous, as those specs will barely be able to
    run the game.
    </p>  
  <p>
    Alan Wake 2 takes a different approach from its predecessor as it's more 
    focused on survival horror. Remedy seems to have taken great inspiration 
    from Capcom’s Resident Evil franchise. Limited items, dark environments, 
    and the use of small groups of enemies that take several bullets to take 
    down provide the game with its survival-horror feel made popular by Capcom. 
  </p>
  <p>Alan Wake 2 has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from several 
    different sources. Creative writing, smooth gameplay, and remarkable 
    visuals have allowed Alan Wake 2 to lead the charge for a game of the year.
