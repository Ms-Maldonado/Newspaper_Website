  <p> Little Nightmares is a horror-adventure game which was released on April 
    28, 2017. Developed by Tarsier Studios and published by Bandai Namco 
    Entertainment, this game introduces platform elements as well as a 
    variety of puzzles. Little Nightmares provides a mysterious world with a 
    great horror environment for players to experience. Set in a “dollhouse” 
    perspective, having the surroundings disproportionately bigger allows 
    players to see what children see.
  </p>
  <p>Little Nightmares is set on the Maw, an underwater mobile iron island 
    that operates as a resort for extremely ravenous guests. You play as Six, 
    a little girl in a yellow raincoat who explores the Maw and its dark 
    mysteries, assuming her goal is to escape the Maw. Six's lack of strength 
    results in players using stealth to traverse the Maw, trying to save 
    themselves from characters such as the Janitor, the Twin Chefs, and the 
    owner of the Maw herself. Like the guest of the Maw, Six also has a 
    growing hunger players must overcome. The story of Little Nightmares 
    isn't clear, so this gives players a chance to theorize what happens 
    in the story, making the game even more fun.
    </p>

    Little Nightmares has received multiple awards and nominations. In 2018 
    at Nordic Game Awards, Little Nightmares won awards for both “Best Audio” 
    and “Best Art”. The jury says, “Every area feels like a coherent piece of 
    set design, traversed by vividly animated creatures.”
  </p>
  <p>Little Nightmares is not the only game in this now-growing franchise. 
    Very Little Nightmares is a mobile game released in 2019. Little Nightmares 
    II is a prequel released in 2021 that introduces a two-player game. Finally, 
    Little Nightmares III is set to release in 2024 following two new characters 
    in new environments. There was also a story-based podcast released in 2023, 
    which expands on the horrifying and intriguing world of Little Nightmares 
    even more.
