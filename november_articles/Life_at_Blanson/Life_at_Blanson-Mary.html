  <p> Here at Blanson CTE, I feel that we all follow such a different path. From HHS to IET and CMAT, we all have entirely different interests and different futures in front of us. During my three years here at this school, having such a diversified community has allowed me to associate with those who are our opposite. As someone in IET, making new friends in CMAT and HHS has been eye-opening. They have taught me that even though our futures hold different outcomes, we can learn from each other. Blanson allows us to learn from people who see their lives differently. Some dream of college, while others are excited to join the workforce. Everyone here has a plan, and it's refreshing to see your peers sharing the same motivation. We’ve all made a group effort to be the best possible version of ourselves, and as a group, we’ve helped each other along the way. Although we do not have a football team or cheerleaders to cheer us on, we have the student community, which I have seen as the best. We strive to pick each other up and provide a shoulder to lean on during any inconvenience. We may be different, but it allows us to be exactly who we are.
