  <p> Are you searching for a book that will keep you turning the pages? A book that will make you 
    want to know what’s going to happen next? If you’re into reading romance, fantasy, magic, and 
    suspenseful books, I have just the book for you. The Red Queen is about two worlds divided by 
    blood, red, or silver. The Reds were commoners, ruled by the Silvers which held god-like powers. 
    Mare Barrow is a seventeen-year-old red girl from poverty in the Stilts. She finds herself working 
    in the Silver Palace surrounded by all the people she hates. Despite her Red blood, she finds 
    that she possesses a power of her own. Fearful of what others may think, the Silver King and 
    queen announce that she is a long-lost Silver princess soon to be married to the Silver Prince. 
    Despite risking her death, she works with a Red Guard in secret to bring down the Silver regime.  
    The world Mare thought she lived in was full of betrayal and lies, but Mare has entered a dangerous 
    game. Reds against Silvers, prince against prince, and Mare against her heart. Will she make 
    the right choice in the end? Or will everything she worked so hard for go down into flames? 
  </p>
  <p>The book Red Queen is in fact a series that continues to the fifth book named Broken Throne.  
    There are many quotes that fans love from Victoria Aveyard and her Red Queen book series such as: 
    “In the fairy tales, the poor girl smiles when she becomes a princess. Right now, I don’t know if 
    I’ll ever smile again.” -Red Queen, “No one is born a monster. But I wish some people were. It 
    would make it easier to hate them, to kill them, to forget their dead faces.” -Glass Sword. Many 
    fans say that they feel what the main character Mare is feeling during the difficult times she’s 
    going through. Throughout the book, there will be many parts that will keep you up at night wondering 
    different scenarios of what will occur in the next chapter. This jaw-dropping book received a 9 
    out of ten rating and a 4.5 star rating on many book websites. </p>
