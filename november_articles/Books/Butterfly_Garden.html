  <p> I recently read a book called “The Butterfly Garden", and it easily turned into one of 
    my favorite books. It was a suspenseful and gripping thriller that kept me on my feet. 
    The book starts off with officers interrogating a survivor, Maya, one of the victims 
    from the garden full of “butterflies”- young women who have been kidnapped and intricately 
    tattooed to resemble the new names they were given. The officers have suspicion that she is 
    somehow involved with the kidnappings since the other survivors wouldn't speak with anyone 
    without talking to Maya first. Victor and Brandon are assigned to the task of making her 
    talk and hear her side of the story. She slowly reveals stories of her tragic past and 
    of horrific tales of a man who’d go to any length to hold beauty captive. The more she 
    shares the more the agents have suspicions that she is hiding something.
  </p>
  <p>The Butterfly Garden quickly became Dot Hutchisons’ most famous book with 4.1/5 stars on 
    good reads, it was even nominated for best horror in 2016. The book gained so much attention 
    that they mentioned it was to be turned into a movie, with the director being Oscar winner, 
    Michael Sugar. I truly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of thriller books and is 
    looking for a good book to read.</p>
